#### Master Blockchain Development
- [X] JavaScript
- [ ] React
- [ ] Remix 
- [ ] Solidity & Assembly 
- [ ] Web3.js 
- [ ] Ganache 
- [ ] Truffle 
- [ ] Mythrill
- [ ] Geth

#### Tips
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test your smart contracts
- [ ] Check test coverage with solidity-coverage
- [ ] Run a Solidity linter like Solhint
- [ ] Use Solidity libraries like Openzeppelin
- [ ] Learn how to code Solidity Assembly
- [ ] Optimize your smart contract for gas (Gas optimization)
- [ ] Ethgasstation.info
- [ ] Continuous integration for smart contracts
- [ ] Proof-of-Work & Proof-of-Stake
- [ ] CI/CD 
- [ ] IDS, DDoS, SIEM, WAF, HSM

#### Tips UI/UX of your dapp
- [ ] Have a "read-only mode" for users without wallets
- [ ] Support multiple wallets
- [ ] Don’t trigger Metamask Dapp approval popup too early
- [ ] Describes clearly the effects of transactions
- [ ] Show feedback after sending transactions
- [ ] Keep the UI up-to-date with smart contract data

#### Tips to gas optimization
- [ ] Minimize on-chain data
- [ ] Use libraries 
- [ ] Use ERC 1167 for cloning contract
- [ ] Turn on the solidity optimizer
- [ ] Use events
- [ ] Write literal values instead of computed one
- [ ] Avoid to copy stuff (arrays…), use storage pointer instead
- [ ] Avoid for-loops over dynamic ranges
- [ ] Optimize the order of variable declarations
- [ ] Use eth-gas-reporter
- [ ] Developing test software
